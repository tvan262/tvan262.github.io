<p>I am a woman with a plan. I don't know why I like to be busy, especially like to planning and controlling everything around me. I also love to learning new things everyday because I am so curious .  I am a mother of three wonderful young kids (from 2-7). I don't have time to learn in daytime, when my kids are around because they are so much fun, so I can not refuse to join their games. Then I have an idea that I can learning coding in the evening, then I try and it works. Lucky me :).  I believe that after I graduate from this class, I can get a better job and can teach my kids about coding. Then we can explore the whole world together because everyday is a new adventure.</p>
