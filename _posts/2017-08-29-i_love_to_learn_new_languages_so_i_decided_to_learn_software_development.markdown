I love to traveling, talking and learning new things from people around the world. So for me, knowing one language is not enough. I am Vietnamese, and I can speak English, a little bit in Spanish, and still learning Japanese, Chinese, Spanish. I know it hard to learn and influence five languages at a time, and they will cost me a lot of time to complete my foreign languages wishlist. Even though, it's better to have a bad plan than no plan, so I just keep this plan in mind and try my best. I learn anytime, anywhere, and whenever I have time.

When, I heard about an interesting language is Ruby on the TV show, then I found out there are much more other new languages from coding program. After I turned off my TV, I felt so exciting and curious about coding. But, I did not do anything more than just remember that. Because I have to do my job at home as an ebay power seller, taking care of my three kids from three to seven years young, helping my husband doing paperworks for a small business...

One lucky day, my kids showed me some game to learn coding on their ipad, I felt so happy, just like when I found something that I love but got lost for many years. When I was playing coding games with my kids, I had an idea that why did learn to code so I can teach my kids about coding. Or I can create some cool apps for them to learning while playing. The day after I played coding games, I read an article about Flatiron school and I decided to join to the class.
